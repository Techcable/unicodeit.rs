# License
The unicodeit.rs project is primarily licensed under the MIT license, with some data under the LaTeX Project Public License 1.3c. This combination has the [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/) `MIT AND LPPL-1.3c` and matches the terms of the upstream unicodeit project.

Each source and data file has a SPDX identifier at the top, indicating which licenses are applicable to that file. If not specified, the file only falls under the primary MIT license. Both licenses are approved by the Open Source Initiative. Unfortunately, the FSF has ruled the LPPL-1.3a is incompatible with the GPL.

The original license file of the unicoideit project is available under `licenses/unicodeit-LICENSE.txt` or at [1]. The LaTex Project Public License 1.3c is available under `licenses/latex-LICENSE.txt` or at [2].  A copy of the primary license is available bellow, which applies to all files not explicitly stated to be under another license.
